## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Basics of positioning elements
- Making use of containers
- Flexbox basics 
- HTML and CSS styling based on Google's conventions

### Continued development

- Relative vs Absolute positioning
- Filling containers rather than hard-coding sizes
- Responsive pages for different devices
- Approaching the design process in a more intelligent way

### Useful resources

Originally I was looking for some examples of how to overlay images, but these ended up leading me down the wrong path for the solution. I ended up overlaying a `div` using a similar technique (as the `view` symbol was so small, the container was required to fill the overlay).
