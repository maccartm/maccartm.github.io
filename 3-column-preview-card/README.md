## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I once read that it can be helpful to put a small green border on items to get an indiciation of how they appear. This could have been helpful in this project, and I started incorporating it towards the end. 

I had issues with centering items within the outermost div (the whole page), and often confused myself with how my html was structured. My `body` was a `div`, to center responsively on the browser window. I also had a large `main` to keep the cards and attribution relatively centered. 

### Continued development

I need to spend more time with the Mozilla documentation regarding flexboxes. I also may have been better served using a grid layout here - though I chose flexbox as I know it well enough.
